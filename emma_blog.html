            <p>Hey Emma,</p>
            <p>It sounds like that person would not be a very good person. And Bob could definitely face serious consequences. I will answer your questions to the best of my ability.</p>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>1. What is the morning after pill and how do I get it?</strong></p>
                <p>The morning after pill serves as an emergency contraception method. You can obtain it from a pharmacy over the counter. You only need to take it once. It works by preventing or delaying ovulation. I would recommend getting the Levonorgestrel-based pill because it is most effective within 24 hours with a 95% chance of effectiveness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>2. Should I be concerned about contracting an STI?</strong></p>
                <p>You should absolutely be concerned about contracting an STI. Since you and Bob had unprotected sex, there is a chance he could have passed an STI to you. An STI could lead to infertility, lower abdominal pain, burning during sex and urination, and more. You should contact your GP or closest Sexual Health Clinic to make sure you don’t have one.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>3. What are the legal implications for Bob, given my age?</strong></p>
                <p>In Victoria, the legal age of consent for sexual activity is generally 16. However, there are specific age differences considered. Considering that you are 15 and Bob is 18, he could potentially face severe legal consequences, including jail time. He took advantage of you when you were intoxicated and had sex with an underage girl. I would highly recommend taking action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>4. How might I be feeling after this experience?</strong></p>
                <p>You could be feeling scared, worried, disappointment in yourself, sadness, etc. These feelings are reasonable, and anybody in your situation would be feeling them. I would just highly recommend getting the morning after pill as soon as possible, and then the risk of pregnancy will significantly drop.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>5. Was this a respectful relationship?</strong></p>
                <p>You were not in a respectful relationship considering that Bob took advantage of you while you were most vulnerable to do what he wanted.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>6. How could my friends have helped prevent this?</strong></p>
                <p>Your friends could have stayed sober and watched over you to make sure nothing like that happened. Your friends could have still been drunk too but kept an eye on each other so nothing happened. They could have seen Bob acting weird/inappropriate and intervened. Or you all could have set up a buddy system to make sure no one was left alone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>7. What are my options moving forward regarding potential pregnancy?</strong></p>
                <p>You should take the morning after pill first to avoid pregnancy. But if it fails and pregnancy still occurs, then you could try other abortion methods. Or if you end up having the baby, then put it up for adoption if you don’t want it and no one else can take care of it. And you should discuss these options with a sexual health professional or a trusted counsellor that could give unbiased advice and help. A local sexual health clinic would be a good place to call to get confidential advice.</p>
