        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>Hello Kate,</p>
            <p>Thank you for reaching out to our health clinic. I will be answering to the best of my ability.</p>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>1. How did I get it? Are there any signs & symptoms that I could look for?</strong></p>
                <p>Chlamydia is transmitted through oral, anal, or vaginal sex with another person who has chlamydia. You should be checking for symptoms such as pus in your urine, an increased need to pee, abnormal vaginal discharge, bleeding between periods or after sex, burning or stinging when urinating, pain during sex, and lower abdominal pain.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>2. Where could I go for a test that is local, what will the test be and what does treatment involve?</strong></p>
                <p>You can go to your GP or any health clinic near you for the test; they are all capable of testing. The test is a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which simply means they use a urine sample or vaginal discharge to test for the DNA of the chlamydia bacteria. For treatments, there are two different options: either 100mg of doxycycline twice a day over 7 days, or a single dose of 1gm of azithromycin.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>3. If I decide not to go ahead with treatment, what will the consequences be?</strong></p>
                <p>If you decide not to go ahead with either treatment, you may develop Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID). You can experience pelvic and abdominal pain, and in later stages, you may become infertile or get an ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy that occurs outside of the womb).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>4. Do I need to tell anyone that I have STI? If so, what do I tell this person?</strong></p>
                <p>You do not need to tell anyone except for your sexual partners. I would recommend saying that you simply have chlamydia and ask if they want to risk it. You both can use a male or female condom to prevent the transfer of the disease.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>5. Will I still be able to have sex?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, you are still able to have sex, but use a male or female condom to prevent the transfer of chlamydia.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <p><strong>6. Because I have contracted an STI, what are the changes I need to make towards future sexual health decisions?</strong></p>
                <p>If you choose to treat it, I would recommend asking your sexual partner when they last took an STI/STD test, and when they last had sex. If they last had sex before they took a test last, they most likely won't have one. If you do not get treatment, I would recommend telling people you are going to have sex with that you have an STI and that you should use contraception.</p>

            <p>Regards,</p>
